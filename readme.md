## Documentation

This sample project contains reactjs as front end, in the directory osculant-app.
The backend uses nodejs express framework and sqlite3 as a database tool for storage, in the directory osculent-backend.

# After cloning the project, you have to navigate to both the directories and start the servers, by default the client server runs on the port 3000 and backend runs on port 4000.

## Click on the directories to read more about the project methods and how to start and use it for testing.
